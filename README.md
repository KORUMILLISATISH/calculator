Step 1: Build the Basic HTML Structure:
In the index.html file, create the HTML structure for your app and add the HTML Boilerplate with linking files (style.css, script.js) into an HTML file.
First, will add the div with the class attribute value of the container inside the body element. The div tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

Step 2: Style Your App with CSS:
In the style.css file, and add CSS rules to make your app visually appealing.
We are setting all elements to have zero margins and zero padding, this will make the same in all the browsers. with the help of * and the font family Helvetica Neue. and then will set the background color to the entire body with styles to the container too.
After Adding Styles to the body and container this is how our output will look like.

Step 3: Implement the JavaScript Functionality:
In the script.js file, which will write the JavaScript code to make your app interactive. Create declarations and functions for manipulating operations in the calculator. You can use the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate elements in your HTML.
First will declare all the declarations with the help of a document object, the document object represents the owner of all other objects on your web page.
with the help of this above declaration will manage to show input/output for the operations that the user performed in the calculator.
